\chapter{Discussion}

{\Large notes} \fxnote{delete this part its just to brainstorm what to write in this section}\\
- Placement of IMU\\
- Choice of Statspace variables for controller - minimize overshoot vs faster braking for wheel\\
- cut-off frequency of the complementary filter?\\
- code accessibility?\\
- classical controller?\\


As already mentioned briefly in the complementary filter section, the measurement from the accelerometer in the IMU could be improved by moving the sensor to a position where it would be influenced less by the acceleration of the frame but still be able to measure the angle of the frame. 

For the state space controller a set of poles were selected looking at the response they showed in the two simulations, \figref{catchingStateSpace} and \figref{catchingStateSpaceWheel}. Using different pole combinations results in different overshoots and settling time, so another pole combination could be selected if a different behavior of the Cubli was desired. The choice is whether a small overshoot is desired or if the frame is to reach \SI{0}{rad} faster. Having less overshoot would increase the maximum catching angle with the current system, since the second overshoot with the current used controller is larger than the angle inflicted by a disturbance. Braking the wheel faster gives the controller more acceleration to use in order to counteract a disturbance. \fxnote{rephrase the "more accel" thing}
