\chapter{Discussion}

{\Large notes} \fxnote{delete this part its just to brainstorm what to write in this section}\\
- Placement of IMU\\
- Choice of Statspace variables for controller - minimize overshoot vs faster braking for wheel\\
- cut-off frequency of the complementary filter?\\

As already mentioned briefly in the complementary section the measurement from the accelerometer in the IMU could be improved by moving the sensor to a position where it would be influenced less by the acceleration of the frame but still be able to measure the angle of the frame.
