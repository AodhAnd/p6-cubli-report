\chapter{Perspective}

The next step will be to built the full Cubli, since now the control can be done using only with components attached to the frame. This design  needs to include the control of three reaction wheels to control each of the directions that it could move in.

It is possible that the controller no longer needs to balance each of them in upright position but to do another kind of maneuvers, which will require a new controller since the chosen one is not able to get a reference for the internal states different from zero.

This new configuration may also need the system to be able to jump up from resting position and then the brake system must be taken into account for each of the wheels. 



- Jump up\\
- 3D Cube\\
- Deep more in other possibilities of controllers\\
- May not need to balance, but to do another maneuvers -----> other controller -----> same model\\
- Show and advertise control engineering \\
