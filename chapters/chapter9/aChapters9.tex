\chapter{State Space Controller}\label{chap:stateSpaceController}
State space representation describes a system with a set of first-order differential equations. This can be done through the use of state variables, which describe internal states of the system. This representation gives a very convenient way of analyzing systems that have several inputs and outputs.\cite{GFranklin}

In this chapter the state space description of the system is derived and a controller capable of maintaining it in equilibrium position is designed.
