\chapter{System Modeling}
With the given setup being described, it is necessary to study its natural behavior in more detail by deriving a model of this system. This chapter shows the process used to put up this model.

A mechanical drawing of the Cubli showing angles and coordinate system conventions is seen in \figref{cubliMechanical}. A two-dimensional global coordinate system is chosen with its origin on the pivot point of the frame. Moreover, the positive direction of the angles is chosen to be clockwise.

In next section, a complete model of the given setup is derived from Newton's Second Law of motion and rotation.
