\section{Complementary filter}
The complementary filter is used to combine the measurement data from the accelerometer and gyros in the two IMUs mounted on the Cubli frame. 
Based on the data from \appref{IMUMeasurementsAppendix} it can be seen that the accelerometer can detect changes in the angle, but has problems with measuring fast changes in the angle.\fxnote{source?, also reason for error seems to be fast and large?} 
The problem with the data from the gyro is an accumulating error which is caused by the integration done to convert angular velocity into an usable angle. It is also known that the gyros will exhibit a drifting error when experiencing small and slow movement.\fxnote{source on gyro error?, B}
 
As described in \secref{sec:Sensors} there are mounted two IMU's on the frame of the Cubli. One of the requirements are to have the Cubli balance in an upright position independently of the orientation of the baseplate.

Based on ... \fxnote{why did we choose an complementary filter?}

The two angle measurements of the IMU are sent through a filter and then summed in order to get an angle of the Cubli frame.
%Data from the accelerometer is used to calculate an angle of the Cubli frame.
%The gyroscope measurement is integrated to get the angle of the Cubli frame. Both measurements are done to find the change on the axis of movement of the Cubli.
 
This is done to counteract drift of the gyroscope and error of the accelerometer.\fxnote{elaborate on the errors}

\end{figure}

The filter for the IMU is going to be done as shown in \figref{blockDrawingComplementaryFilter} with a low pass filter on the measurements from the accelerometer, and an integration followed by a high pass filter on the measurements from the gyroscope. \cite{OlliW} \fxnote{might not be the correct source for this part, but it is a source that is useful for the part, B}
\begin{flalign}
	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{1}{ 1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot accel\_\theta_{F}}   &\\
	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{\tau \cdot s}{ 1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot \frac{1}{s} \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F}}&
	\label{complementaryBlockFilters}
\end{flalign}
Combining the two equations yields \eqref{complementaryCombinedFilter}
\begin{flalign}
	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{1}{ 1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot accel\_\theta_{F} + \frac{\tau \cdot s}{ 1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot \frac{1}{s} \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F} = \frac{accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F}}{1 + \tau \cdot s}}
	\label{complementaryCombinedFilter}
\end{flalign}
The \si{\tau} is the cut-off frequency of the two filters. Changing this constant decides how much two different sensor measurements weight in on the combined angle.
 
In oder to use the complementary filter on the cubli it needs to be discretized. This is done with the bilinear transformation method where \si{s = \frac{2}{\Delta T}\cdot \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}}
Rewritting \eqref{complementaryCombinedFilter} yields
\begin{flalign}
 	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{1}{1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F})}
 	\label{discreteComplementaryFilter1}
\end{flalign}
Now s is replaced
\begin{flalign}
  	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{1}{1 + \tau \cdot \frac{2}{\Delta T}\cdot \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}} \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F})}
  	\label{discreteComplementaryFilter2}
\end{flalign}
  
\begin{flalign}
  	\eq{\Updownarrow \theta_{F}} {\frac{\Delta T \cdot (1 + z^{-1})}{\Delta T \cdot (1 + z^{-1})+2\cdot (1 - z^{-1})\cdot \tau} \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F})}
  	\label{discreteComplementaryFilter3}
\end{flalign}
  
\begin{flalign}
   	\eq{\Updownarrow \theta_{F}} {\frac{\Delta T + \Delta T \cdot z^{-1})}{(2\cdot \tau + \Delta T) - (2\tau - \Delta T)\cdot z^{-1}} \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F})}
   	\label{discreteComplementaryFilter4}
\end{flalign}
   
Implementing \eqref{discreteComplementaryFilter4} yields following piece of code \fxnote{USE the current form in the controller code file}
\begin{lstlisting}
/**
*  delta_T is the sampling time = 0.01 s
*  tau is the cut-off frequency of the low and high pass filters
*/
theta_f[n] = ((2*tau-delta_T) / (2*tau+delta_T)) * theta[n-1] + 
	(delta_T / (2*tau+delta_T)) * (acc_theta[n] + gyro_thetaDot[n] + acc_theta[n-1] + gyro_thetaDot[n-1]) 

\end{lstlisting}

The cut-off frequency for the filters can be determined by making a least square approximation of the error between the complimentary angle and the angle measured with the potentiometer.
