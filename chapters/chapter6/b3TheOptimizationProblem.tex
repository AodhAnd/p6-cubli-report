\subsection{The Optimization Problem}
The basic scheme for the optimization problem is given in \figref{SensToolSchema}.

	\caption{Schematic of the optimization problem, where input (u(t)) and output(y(t)) data is logged. The input data is used with the simulation to generate the simulation output (\si{y_{m}(t)}). The real output and the simulated output are then compared and an adjustment is made to the parameters of the simulation. Then a new \si{y_{m}(t)} is generated with the u(t) and compared to the y(t). This process is iterated until a satisfactory match between y(t) and \si{y_{m}(t)} is achieved\cite{Senstools}.}

The provided data is taken from an initial value test of the Cubli hanging down like a pendulum, see \appref{app:impulseResponseAppendix}.
As the operating angle goes from \si{-0,15\ to\ 0,15\ rad}, the behavior at this range will be better if the fit is done between this operating points. 

Furthermore, the nonlinear model is used to accurately describe the oscillatory behavior of the pendulum. The model is modified such that it describes the system as a regular pendulum without the dynamics of the reaction wheel, in order to match the test conditions under which the data was extracted, as seen in \figref{blockDiagramSenseTool}.

In order to minimize the difference between the data points measured in test and the output of the model, a function to describe such a relationship is needed. The performance function used to describe goodness of the fit, is a mean square error function.
%
\begin{flalign}
	\eq{P(\vec{\theta})} {\frac{1}{2N}\sum_{k = 1}^{N} \left(\vec{y}(kT) - \vec{y_m}(kT, \vec{\theta})\right)^2 } &
\label{performanceFunction}
\end{flalign}
%
\hspace{6mm} Where:\\
\begin{tabular}{ p{1cm} l l l}
& \si{\vec{\theta}}   & is the parameter(s) to be adjusted                  & \\
& \si{N}              & is the degrees of freedom for each parameter        & \\
& \si{k}              & is the sample indexes, \si{k=1,\ 2,} ...\si{,\ N}   & \\
& \si{T}              & is the sampling time                                & \\
& \si{\vec{y}}        & is the test measurement output vector               & \\
& \si{\vec{y_m}}      & is the model output vector                          & \\
\end{tabular}

A normal mean square error function is only divided by the degrees of freedom, \si{N}, but in tis case is divided by \si{2N} to cancel out the factor which arises when computing its gradient. This does not have any impact since the minimum maintains its original position.
