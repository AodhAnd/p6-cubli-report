\section{Parameter Estimation using Optimization}\label{sec:parameterEstimationUsingOptimization}
In this section methods for optimization are investigated. The base of the implementation is in this case a Matlab script which is fed with test data along with the model simulation, whose task is to fit the model output to the test data by adjusting one or more parameters in the model. In this case the model representation supplied to the script is a Simulink model, which can then be run by the script whenever needed and the script can modify the parameters to be adjusted. The process is iterative.
