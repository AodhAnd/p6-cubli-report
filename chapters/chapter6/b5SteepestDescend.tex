\subsection{Steepest Descend Method}
The steepest descend method also, uses the gradient to determine in which direction the local minimum lies; the method is therefor also often refereed to as the gradient descend method. However, in the steepest descend method, the problem is minimized along the gradient in each iteration, as opposed to just taking a step as described in the previous.\\
To achieve this minimization along the gradient, one often uses a line search algorithm. There exists several line search algorithms, such as Dichotomous, Golden Section, Fibonacci, backtracking line search and so on. For the purpose of minimizing the one-dimensional problems in the gradient directions the Fibonacci line search is further investigated in the following section.
