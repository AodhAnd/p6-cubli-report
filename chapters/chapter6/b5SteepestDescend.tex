\subsection{Steepest Descend Method}
The steepest descend method or gradient descend, also, as the name suggests, uses the gradient to determine in which direction the local minimum lies. However, in the steepest descend method, the problem is minimized along the gradient in each iteration. To achieve this, one often uses a line search algorithm. There exists several line search algorithms, such as Dichotomous, Golden Section, Fibonacci, backtracking line search and so on. For the purpose of minimizing the one-dimensional problems in the gradient directions the Fibonacci line search is further investigated in the following section.
