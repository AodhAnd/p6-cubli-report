\subsection{Steepest Descend Method}
The steepest descent method also uses the gradient to determine in which direction the local minimum lies; the method is therefore also often referred to as the gradient descent method. In the steepest descent method, the problem is minimized along the gradient in each iteration, as opposed to just taking a step as described in the previous.\\
To achieve this minimization along the gradient, one often uses a line search algorithm. There exists several line search algorithms, such as Dichotomous, Golden Section, Fibonacci, backtracking line search and so on. For the purpose of minimizing the one-dimensional problems in the gradient directions, the Dichotomous and Fibonacci line searchers are further investigated in the following sections. To use the line search however, a region in which the minimum is assumed to reside (the bracket) must be provided.\cite{AAntoniou}\\
In the following such a region is assumed given, but in the section following the two line searchers, a method for selecting a bracket is discussed.
