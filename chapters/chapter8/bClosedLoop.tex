\section{Closed Loop Response}\label{closedLoop}
A first approximation of the system's behavior in closed loop can be done through a proportional controller.

Such a system is tested with a gain of 10 as a controller. \Figref{closedLoopResponse} shows the response of the simulation and the one from the real setup under a similar fall test as in \appref{fallResponseAppendix}.

It is clear that, upon application of a \SI{0}{rad} reference and a minimal initial offset, the closed loop function with only a gain of 10 has an unstable response.
