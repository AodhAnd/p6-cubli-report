\section{Proportional Controller}\label{chap:pController}
Although a proportional controller can not be the final solution to balance the Cubli, it can be used to do a first approximation to the behavior of the system in closed loop.

The comparison between both responses, the simulated and the real one, with a contoller of gain 10 can be seen in \figref{closedLoopResponse}. 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Behavior of the closed loop function with a proportional controller and a reference of 0 rad}
	\label{closedLoopResponse}
\end{figure}
It is clear that the closed loop function has an unstable response when a reference of 0 rad is required.
