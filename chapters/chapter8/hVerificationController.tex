\subsection{Discrete Controller Verification}\label{ssec:discreteControllerVerification}
It is necessary to verify that the discretized controller matches the original continuous one, and is also able to maintain the Cubli in the upright position. This is done firstly, by simulating the feedback system and comparing the newly made discrete controller with the continuous simulation from figref{fig:continuousControllerSimulation}, see \figref{fig:discreteVsContinuousSimulation}.
