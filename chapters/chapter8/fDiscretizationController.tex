\section{Discretization of the Controller}\label{sec:discnController}
%The designed controller is shown to be working in the simulation environment. The next step is to actually implement it in reality. 
Since the controller appears stable from the root-locus and Nyquist plots analysis, the controller calculations are to be implemented for testing on the system. \\
All the controller computations are made on the Beaglebone Black board, which is a computer and cannot run continuously. This means that the controller has to go through a discretization, i.e. that an approximation of the continuous-time controller is made in the discrete-time domain.

The discretization process of a controller consists of mapping frequencies from the continuous domain to the discrete domain (z-domain), with respect to the sampling time, \si{T}, of the feedback control system:
%
\begin{flalign} 
  &\si{s = j \omega \to z = e^{s T}}\label{exp:cont2Disc}&
\end{flalign}
%
The sampling time is chosen to be \SI{0,01}{s}. This decision is based on the results from \appref{app:TimingProgram}, where it can be seen that the code takes  around \SI{0,008}{s}, and the presence of a digital filter in the IMU with cut-off frequency \SI{260}{Hz}, see \appref{app:IMUSetupRetrieval}. To avoid timing issues and aliasing, a frequency of \SI{100}{Hz} is chosen and results in the sampling time previously mentioned.

Since, by definition, the discrete domain cannot represent the complete behavior of a system through time, approximations are used to estimate this behavior. Different methods are briefly described and compared hereafter.

The most direct method is the Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) approximation. It mimics a Digital to Analog Converter's output behavior by holding a value of a certain amplitude during a time as long as the defined sampling time. Although it matches reality correctly as long as the signal does not change too much between each sample, it does not fit as well at high frequencies. Thus, it translates into phase lag in the frequency domain and can cause trouble in closed-loop systems.\\
Another of the most commonly used aproximations is the bilinear transform (or Tustin's method) which is based on the trapezoidal integration principle. A reason to use this method instead of others is that it maps the entire LHP (stable area in the continuous domain) into the unit circle (stable area in the discrete domain)\cite{GFranklin}.\\
The bilinear approximation of \si{z} is defined as:
%
\begin{flalign} 
  &\si{z \approx \frac{1 + s \frac{T}{2}}{1 - s\frac{T}{2}}}\label{exp:bilinearTransform}&
\end{flalign}
%
The inverse transformation of \expr{exp:bilinearTransform} is given by:
%
\begin{flalign} 
  &\si{s \approx \frac{T}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}}\label{exp:inverseBilinearTransform}&
\end{flalign}
%
In general, the \expr{exp:inverseBilinearTransform} is used to replace \si{s} in the continuous-time transfer function of the designed controller. However, due to the non-linear mapping induced by the discretization, a pre-warp of the frequencies can be used before discretizing. This avoids effects of phase lag near the cross-over frequency and thus, also avoids unwanted reduction of gain and phase margins. \cite{GGu,AVOppenheim} 

Moreover, Matlab has an available function, \lstinline[style=custommatlabinline]{c2d()}, designed to convert a continuous system's transfer function into the discrete domain by specifying the sampling time (here, \si{T = 0,01\ s}) and the desired method (\lstinline[style=custommatlabinline]{'zoh'}, \lstinline[style=custommatlabinline]{'tustin'} or \lstinline[style=custommatlabinline]{'prewarp'}). When using the \lstinline[style=custommatlabinline]{'prewarp'} option, a supplementary argument is needed, corresponding to the critical fequency, \cite{Matlabc2d}.\\
Here, \si{33,5\ rad \cdot s^{-1}} is chosen as the critical pre-warp frequency, as it corresponds to the point at which the phase lag is at its maximum on the open loop Bode plot of the continuous plant and controller, see \figref{fig:bodeOpenLoopContinuous}.

  \label{fig:bodeOpenLoopContinuous}
\end{figure}
%
\Figref{fig:bodePrewarpVsNoPrewarpVsContinuousOpenLoop} shows Bode plots comparing open loops with the original continuous controller against the discretized controller's with ZOH, normal Tustin's method and pre-warping.

  \label{fig:bodePrewarpVsNoPrewarpVsContinuousOpenLoop}
\end{figure}
%
From \figref{fig:bodePrewarpVsNoPrewarpVsContinuousOpenLoop}, it is possible to see that the phase of the ZOH discretized controller diverges from the continuous one's, no later than at \si{3\ rad \cdot s^{-1}}. On the other hand, Tustin discretized controllers match closely with the continuous one until approximately \si{10\ rad \cdot s^{-1}}. \\
The discrete systems here, are only plotted before the vertical line which represents the Nyquist frequency, i.e.~a half of the sampling frequency, chosen earlier in this section. More importantly, the two discrete versions of the controller, the orange one using a simple Tustin method and the purple one using also pre-warping, seem very similar both in frequency and phase.

However, pre-warping should improve the matching between the discretized version and the continuous version of the controller, by re-mapping frequencies to reduce the bilinear transform's distortion. Thus, given some appropriate pre-warp frequency, the discretized system's poles are scaled, so that it becomes realizable.\\
Thus, the pre-warped discretized controller is chosen for the actual implementation on the Cubli, in the code base, see \secref{sec:codeBase}, and its discrete transfer function is:
\begin{flalign}
  \eq{D(z)} {\frac{\tau_{m,w}(z)}{e_{\theta}(z)} = \frac{\num{-8,314} + \num{7,422} \cdot z^{-1} + \num{8,302} \cdot z^{-2} - \num{7,434} \cdot z^{-3}}{1 - \num{1,382} \cdot z^{-1} + \num{0,3415} \cdot z^{-2} + \num{0,001638} \cdot z^{-3}}} &%\unit{N \cdot m} 
  \label{eq:discControllerTf}
\end{flalign}

In this section, the controller designed from the root locus has been discretized. The next step is to translate this discretization in a form that can be run on the micro-computer running the calculations, i.e. the BeagleBone Black.
