\chapter{Controller Design}\label{chap:controllerDesign}
The controller design is a very wide field that goes from classic linear PID controllers to more advance techniques that use numerical optimization.

In this section, different types of linear controllers are presented and analyze in order to check if they are valid for the particular case of the Cubli.
