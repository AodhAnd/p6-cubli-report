\chapter{Classical Controller Design}\label{chap:controllerDesign}
The controller design is a very wide field that goes from classic linear PID controllers to more advance techniques that use numerical optimization.

In this section, a controller designed using classical techniques is presented and analyze in order to check if it is valid for the particular case of the Cubli.
