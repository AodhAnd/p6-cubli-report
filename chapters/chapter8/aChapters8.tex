\chapter{Classical Controller Design}\label{chap:controllerDesign}
The controller design is a very wide field that goes from classic linear PID controllers to more advanced techniques using numerical optimization.

In this chapter, a controller is designed using classical techniques. It is further analyzed to verify its proper action on the Cubli model and the real version.
