\chapter{Classical Controller Design}\label{chap:controllerDesign}
The controller design is a wide field that goes from classic linear PID controllers to more advanced techniques using numerical optimization.

In this chapter, a controller is designed using classical techniques. It is further analyzed to verify if the results fulfilled the requirements.
