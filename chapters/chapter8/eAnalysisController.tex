\section{Analysis of the Controller}\label{analysisController}
A first analysis of the controller can be done through the resultant Nyquist plot.

\fxnote{nyquist of the whole system}

Â¿Stable or not?

Another step in the analysis is by means of a simulation, using the block diagram of the system.

The resultant system can be seen in figures XXX.

\fxnote{Include block diagram with the controller}

When a reference of 0 rad is put on the system, which has a tiny deviation from the equilibrium position in the initial condition, the behavior is the one shown in figures XXX and YYYYY.
