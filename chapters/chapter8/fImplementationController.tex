\section{Implementation of the Controller}\label{impController}
%The designed controller is shown to be working in the simulation environment. The next step is to actually implement it in reality. 
\fxnote{was still mentioning the rootlocus controller was working in simulation, check section again}
Since the controller calculations are to be implemented on the Beaglebone Black board, which is a computer and cannot run continuously, the controller has to go through a discretization. This means that an approximation of it is made in the discrete domain.
