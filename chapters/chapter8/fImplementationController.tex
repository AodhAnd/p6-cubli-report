\section{Implementation of the Controller}\label{impController}
The designed controller being shown to be working in the simulation environment, the next step is to actually implement it in reality.

Since the controller calculations are to be implemented on the Beaglebone Black board, which is a computer and cannot run the controller continuously, the latter has to go through a discretization. This means that an approximation of it is made in the discrete domain.
