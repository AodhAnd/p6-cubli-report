\section{Microcontroller - BeagleBone Black}

The microcontroller used on this system is a BeagleBone Black, which is in charge of managing the data from the motor and the sensors and of calculating the required control action.\\
It uses an ARM processor at a clock frequency of \SI{1}{GHz} and has a large amount of general purpose inputs and outputs, of which some of them support the I2C protocol or include an Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC).\\
In order to use the data from the potentiometer it has to be sampled by the ADC in  the BeagleBone. 
The ADCs of the BeagleBone have a 12-bit resolution that is limited to a range of \si{0 - 1,8 V}. The fastest sampling time it can provide is 125ns\cite{Cameon}.
