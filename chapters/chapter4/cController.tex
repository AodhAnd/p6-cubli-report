\section{Microcontroller - BeagleBone Black}

The microcontroller used on this system is a BeagleBone Black, which is in charge of managing the data from the motor and the sensors and calculating the required control action.
In order to use the data from the potentiometer it has to be sampled by the ADC in  the BeagleBone.
The ADC's of the BeagleBone have a 12-bit resolution that is limited to a range of \si{0 - 1,8 V}. Sampling time is 125ns \cite{Cameon}
