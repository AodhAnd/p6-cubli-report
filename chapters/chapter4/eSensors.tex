\subsection{Potentiometer}
The potentiometer is placed at the corner of the frame that is fixed to an axis and it can be used to measure the actual position of the frame.

However its use is restricted to the one-dimensional Cubli, as it has to be referred to the base, which is not present in the 3D case.


\subsection{IMU}
