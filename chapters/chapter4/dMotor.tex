The last important part included on the system is the braking mechanism, which is used for making the frame go from rest to vertical position. 

To perform this task the motor spins up the reaction wheel and when it has enough kinetic energy the braking mechanism suddenly brake it. This makes that all the energy of the wheel is then transfer to the frame, which reaches the vertical position.
