\chapter{System Description}
One-frame Cubli is a non-linear unstable system which is capable of laying on one of its corners as long as it is properly controlled.

The system can be firstly divided into two main parts: frame and reaction wheel.

\section{Frame}
The frame is a metallic 15x15 cm square that composes the body of Cubli. As it can only be balanced in one direction, it is attached to the base on one of its vertexes to avoid it from falling in any of the other directions.

Another important aspect is that all the electronics needed and the motor are attached to the frame. This has to be taken into account when finding the model, as its  moment of inertia, center of gravity and mass change.

\section{Reaction Wheel}
The reaction wheel is the element of Cubli that is responsible of the movement of the frame. This can be achieved since the rotation of the wheel, which is coupled to the axis of the motor, creates an opposing torque on the body that moves it.
