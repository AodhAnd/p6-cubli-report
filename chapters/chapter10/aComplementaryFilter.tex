\chapter{Angle Measurement with Built-in Sensors}\label{chap:CompFilter}
It is a goal to get the Cubli setup to balance the frame in an upright position independently of the baseplate orientation.

As described in \secref{sec:Sensors} there are two IMUs mounted on the frame of the Cubli. They can be used to achieve this goal since they only depend on the absolute angle and they can also be used in the full Cubli.

\section{Angle Calculations from the IMUs}
The angular position of the Cubli can be calculated using the accelerometer, the gyroscope or combining both. In this section each of the options is describe and analyzed.

\subsection{Angle from the Accelerometer}
The accelerometer measures linear acceleration, and if the accelerometer is attached to a object that does not accelerate with respect to the Earth, the accelerometer will measure the gravitational acceleration. This can be used to determine the orientation of the accelerometer sensor with respect to the Earth \cite{JWarren}.\\
The accelerometers used with the Cubli setup have 3-axis detection as described in \secref{sec:Sensors}. To determine the angle of the frame with the accelerometer it is needed to get the measurements from two of the three axes. The two measurements needed are the ones in line with the frames movement direction, based on the way the IMU is mounted, as shown in \figref{accelerometer}. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/accelerometer}
	\caption{Position of the IMU in the setup}
	\label{accelerometer}
\end{figure}\vspace{-5mm}
%
Based on the markings on the IMU, those are the x and y-axis directions. Taking the two axis measurements shown in figure \ref{accelerometer} the angle can be found using \eqref{accelAngle} \cite{CFisher}. 
%
\begin{flalign}
	\eq{accel\_\theta_{F}} {\arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) + offset}
	\label{accelAngle}
\end{flalign}
%
\hspace{6mm} Where:\\
\begin{tabular}{ p{1cm} l l l}
	& \si{offset=\frac{\pi}{4} + 0,06 = 0,84}                   
\end{tabular}
%

The offset is added because the IMU is mounted with a \si{\frac{\pi}{4}} rotation compared to the orientation of the frame and the \si{0,06} comes from the fact that the equilibrium position is slightly different than the vertical one (see \secref{sec:Sensors}). \fxnote{reference the section where it is explained the first time}.\\
Based on the data from \appref{app:IMUMeasurementsAppendix}, a calculation of the angle using the accelerometers can be done, whose result is shown in \figref{angleAcc}.
%
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figures/angleAcc}
	\caption{Angular position calculation with the data of the accelerometer}
	\label{angleAcc}
\end{figure}\vspace{-5mm}
%
While the Cubli setup tries to balance the frame, the IMU mounted on the top of it will move along with the frame and the spikes seen on the calculated angle data from the accelerometer data in \figref{angleAcc} are because the IMU is moving and the acceleration from this creates a disturbance on the measurement of the gravitational acceleration \cite{JWarren}.\\
A way to minimize this disturbance would be to move the IMU as close as possible to the point of rotation. This way the accelerometer is still able to see the angle of the frame, but the distance it is moved is shorter and the acceleration will be smaller. \fxnote{we didnt do this because we would have to remount the sensor and create a new mount. how to best word that?, B}

\subsection{Angle from the Gyroscope}
The angle of the frame can be found with the gyroscope by integrating the angular velocity measured by the gyroscope on the axis aligned with the direction of motion of the frame as shown in \ref{systemDescription}. \fxnote{correct the ref to the picture of the cubli setup}
\begin{flalign}
	\eq{gyro\_\theta_{F}} {\int_{0}^{n\cdot \Delta T} \omega_{F} \, \mathrm{d}t}
	\label{accelGyro}
\end{flalign}
The problem with the data from the gyro is an accumulating error which is caused by the integration done to convert angular velocity into an usable angle. It is also known that the gyros will exhibit a drifting error when experiencing small and slow movement \cite{JWarren}. These problems can be observed in \figref{angleGyro}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figures/angleGyro}
	\caption{Angular position calculation with the data of the gyroscope}
	\label{angleGyro}
\end{figure}\vspace{-5mm}
%The problem with the data from the gyro is it will exhibit a drifting error when experiencing no movement \cite{JWarren} and since the angular velocity has to be integrated to get the angel there will be an accumulation error. 

\subsection{Data Fusing with Complementary Filter}
In order to filter the drift of the gyroscope and the disturbance errors of the accelerometer a complementary filter can be used to combine both measurements from the IMU mounted on the Cubli frame. This is done with the goal to get a more reliable angle measurement for both when the frame is moving and when its standing still in the equilibrium point.\\
The two angle measurements of the IMU are sent through a filter and then summed in order to get an angle of the Cubli's frame. When the frame is moving fast it is better to rely on the gyroscope data, and when the frame is moving slowly or not at all it is better to rely on the accelerometer data \cite{PGui}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\input{figures/complementaryFilterBlockDiagram.tikz}
	\centering
	\caption{Block diagram of the complementary filter setup used with the IMU on the Cubli}
	\label{blockDrawingComplementaryFilter}
\end{figure}

The filter for the IMU is designed as shown in \figref{blockDrawingComplementaryFilter} with a low pass filter on the measurements from the accelerometer, and an integration followed by a high pass filter on the measurements from the gyroscope \cite{OlliW}. \cite{PGui}
\begin{flalign}
	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{1}{ 1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot accel\_\theta_{F}}   &\\
	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{\tau \cdot s}{ 1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot \frac{1}{s} \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F}}&
	\label{complementaryBlockFilters}
\end{flalign}
Combining the two equations yields \eqref{complementaryCombinedFilter}
\begin{flalign}
	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{1}{ 1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot accel\_\theta_{F} + \frac{\tau \cdot s}{ 1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot \frac{1}{s} \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F} = \frac{accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F}}{1 + \tau \cdot s}} &
	\label{complementaryCombinedFilter}
\end{flalign}
The \si{\tau} is the cut-off frequency of the two filters. Changing this constant decides how much the two different sensor measurements weight in on the combined angle.
 
\section{Discretization of the Complementary Filter} 
In oder to use the complementary filter on the cubli it needs to be discretized. This is done with the bilinear transformation method where \si{s = \frac{2}{\Delta T}\cdot \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}}, with a sample time of 
Rewritting \eqref{complementaryCombinedFilter} yields
\begin{flalign}
 	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{1}{1 + \tau \cdot s} \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F})} &
 	\label{discreteComplementaryFilter1}
\end{flalign}
If s is replaced by its discrete expression, the difference equation can be derived.
\begin{flalign}
  	\eq{\theta_{F}} {\frac{1}{1 + \tau \cdot \frac{2}{\Delta T}\cdot \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}} \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F})} &
  	\label{discreteComplementaryFilter2}
\end{flalign}
%
%\begin{flalign}
%  	\eq{\Updownarrow \theta_{F}} {\frac{\Delta T \cdot (1 + z^{-1})}{\Delta T \cdot (1 + z^{-1})+2\cdot (1 - z^{-1})\cdot \tau} \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F})}
%  	\label{discreteComplementaryFilter3}
%\end{flalign}
  %
\begin{flalign}
   	\eq{\Updownarrow \theta_{F}} {\frac{\Delta T + \Delta T \cdot z^{-1}}{(2\cdot \tau + \Delta T) - (2\tau - \Delta T)\cdot z^{-1}} \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F})} &
\end{flalign}\label{discreteComplementaryFilter4}
%
%\begin{flalign}
%	\eq{\Updownarrow \theta_{F} \cdot ((2\cdot \tau + \Delta T) - (2\tau - \Delta T)\cdot z^{-1})} {\Delta T + \Delta T \cdot z^{-1} \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F} + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F})} &
%\end{flalign}\label{discreteComplementaryFilter5}
%%
\begin{flalign}
	\eqOne{\Updownarrow \theta_{F}[n] \cdot (2\cdot \tau + \Delta T) - \theta_{F}[n-1] \cdot (2\tau - \Delta T)} {\Delta T \cdot (accel\_\theta_{F}[n] + accel\_\theta_{F}[n-1]} 
	\eqTwo{ + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F}[n] + \tau \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F}[n+1])} 
	\label{discreteComplementaryFilter6}
\end{flalign}
%  
\begin{flalign}
	\eqOne{\Updownarrow \theta_{F}[n]}{\frac{(2\cdot \tau + \Delta T)}{2\cdot \tau + \Delta } \cdot \theta_{F}[n-1] + \frac{\Delta T}{2\cdot \tau + \Delta T} \cdot accel\_\theta_{F}[n] + \frac{\Delta T}{2\cdot \tau + \Delta T} \cdot accel\_\theta_{F}[n-1]} 
	\eqTwo{ + \frac{\Delta T \cdot \tau}{2\cdot \tau + \Delta T} \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F}[n] + \frac{\Delta T \cdot \tau}{2\cdot \tau + \Delta T} \cdot gyro\_\dot{\theta}_{F}[n-1]} 
	\label{discreteComplementaryFilter7}
\end{flalign}

Implementing \eqref{discreteComplementaryFilter7} yields to following piece of code. \fxnote{USE the current form in the controller code file}

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Calculation of the Cut-off Frequency}
The cut-off frequency for the filters can be determined by using SensTool and the data obtained through the test detailed in \appref{app:IMUMeasurementsAppendix}. 

The toolbox uses the data form the potentiometer as the real output of the system, the data from the IMUs as the input and the modeling of the system is done through \eqref{discreteComplementaryFilter7}. With this data it can find the optimal value for \si{\tau} based on the difference between the angle measured by the potentiometer and an angle calculated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements done during the same test.

The final fit can be seen in \figref{filterSensTool} and it gives an optimal \si{\tau\ =\ 0,5399\ s}. This results in a cutting frequency for the filter equal to \si{11,63\ rad \cdot s^{-1}}.
