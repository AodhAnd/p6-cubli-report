\section{Proportional Controller}\label{chap:pController}
A proportional controller can be used to do a first approximation to the behavior of the system in closed loop, knowing that it can not be the final solution for the problem.

As it can be seen in \figref{closedLoopResponse}, the closed loop function has an unstable response when a step reference of 1 rad is required.
