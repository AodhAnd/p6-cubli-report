\section{Design Limitations}

At Aalborg University (AAU), there exists a working setup of a one-dimensional Cubli. The overall goals of this semester are to make a model of a system, to simulate this model and then to design and implement a controller for that system. Students on this semester are encouraged to work with pre-made setups, since the focus is rather on the control engineering than the hardware solution.\fxnote{moved the section directly from introduction. Will need a top to catch the previous chapter}
