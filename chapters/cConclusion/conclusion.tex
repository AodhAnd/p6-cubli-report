\chapter{Conclusion}

The aim of this project was to work with an unstable nonlinear system and be able to construct an appropriate model and design a controller capable of balance it around equilibrium position.

First, a pre-analysis was made to the system starting from a description of all the components present in te given setup. It also included the derivation of the equations that describe its dynamics and the description of the system in s-domain. Then the parameters of the setup was found, both with measurements and with an estimation using optimization, to be able to analyze the behavior of the system and compare it with the real model.

Afterwards, a controller was designed to balance the Cubli in upright position using root locus. It was seen that was necessary to control both the position of the frame and the velocity of the wheel so it was decided to use a state space approach.

It was also a requirement to be able to change the angle of the baseplate, which means that the calculation of the angle should be independent of the inclination. It was convenient to use built-in sensors for this purpose, so the final solution was to use an IMU present in the setup and calculate the angle through a complementary filter.

Finally, some acceptance tests were performed to ensure if the final controlled system was able to accomplish the requirements and, similarly, a further analysis was carried to check other capabilities of the Cubli.

In conclusion, a control system that can balance the Cubli in upright position independently of the angle of the baseplate, within a reasonable range, has been designed, implemented and tested successfully.
