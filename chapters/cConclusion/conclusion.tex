\chapter{Conclusion}

The aim of this project was to work with an unstable non linear system and be able to construct an appropriate model and design a controller capable of balance it around equilibrium position.

- Analysis for finding model and parameters using Senstools and our own implementation\\
- Design of a controller with frequency analysis and using root locus\\
- This controller can not set the velocity of the wheel to 0 ------> another one was needed\\
- State space controller to control both position of the frame and velocity of the wheel\\
- Design of a way of measuring the position without relaying in external sensors -----> IMU ------> Complementary Filter\\
- Results fulfill the requirements for the controlled system
