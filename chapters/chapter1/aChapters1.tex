We, as a group, wanted to work with an unlinear system for our bachelor project in control engineering. The choice fell on a form of inverted pendulum. It is a setup called Cubli.\fxnote{add picture of 3d cubli}
The Cubli is a cube that can jump up and balance on one of its sides or one of its corners.\cite{MGajamohan}
In this case the inverted pendulum setup is not controlled by a motor that moves the pendulum, but by a flywheel attached to the square frame. There is one for each of the three axis of motion. 
At AAU we have a one-dimensional setup, based on the Cubli idea. It consists of a metalframe with one flywheel. The idea is to balance the frame on one corner with the help of the flywheel by accelerating the wheel up and down.
