# One-frame Cubli project - Report
#### Project made @ AAU Electronics and IT by students on a 6th semester (2016)

This report can be of help for people willing to learn basics of system modelling and automation or signal processing in the context of an applied (but simple) project. It is the result of a semester work on a "one-sided" self-balancing cube, based on previous work from ETH ZÃ¼richn on a similar project, namely the [Cubli](https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mavt/dynamic-systems-n-control/idsc-dam/Research_DAndrea/Cubli/Cubli_IROS2012.pdf).

/!\ Disclaimer: please be reminded that this is a scholar project. As such, it is mainly aimed at proving that team members were able to apply knowledge from various courses we had at the university and with tools and material that were available to us.
We are not responsible for anything that could happen, this is just our will to share knowledge we have gained from our experience and gathered in a (not so short) report.
