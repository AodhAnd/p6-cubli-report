# One-frame Cubli project - Report
#### Project made @ AAU Electronics and IT by students on a 6th semester (2016)

The template is available in the [main repository](https://github.com/AodhAnd/p6-cubli-main). You should consider it as the __first__ reference for syntax when writing the report! Most of the things you should now are available in this template. If you are looking for something more you can't find, ask Niels to get more information and maybe add or correct macros and package inclusions.

For more info on how to use git you can go to the [main repository](https://github.com/AodhAnd/p6-cubli-main) and search the Internet (there are plenty of tutorials). If you are sill in a trouble after having done all that, just ask me (Julien) your questions. :D
