# One-frame Cubli project - Report
#### Project made @ AAU Electronics and IT by students on a 6th semester (2016)

The template is not done yet, so you should NOT push anything yet until it is up on this repo.

For more info on the use of git you can go to the [main repository](https://github.com/AodhAnd/p6-cubli-main) and search the Internet (there are plenty of tutorials). If you are sill in a trouble after having done all that, just ask me your questions. :D
