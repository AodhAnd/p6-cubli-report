\section*{Purpose}
Compare the response of the real setup with the simulation given by the theoretical model

\section*{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Turn on the power supply}
	\item{Launch the virtual machine}
	\item{Run Eclipse}
	\item{Set the input current of the motor controller to 0 and change the logfile to store the data}
	\item{Connect the computer to the board through the USB cable}
	\item{Load the changed file in the Beaglebone}
	\item{Keep the Cubli near the vertical position}
	\item{Run the program}
	\item{Let the Cubli fall}
	\item{Stop the program}
	\item{Get the measurements from the file and plot them in Matlab}
	\item{Plot th result of the simulations in the same figure and compare them}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Results}

	\label{comparisonRealModel}
\end{figure} 

The result of the experiment (\figref{comparisonRealModel}) shows that the response of the real system has several differences with the one from the simulation.

The fist one is the presence of oscillations in the real response curve. This behavior is due to a small bounce that the frame does when it reaches the base.

Another one is the final position of the frame, but it is due to the existence of a piece of foam at this position in the real case (to avoid the Cubli to hit the base).

The other main difference is the shape of the curve, since the simulation is slower than the real case.
