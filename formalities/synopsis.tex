The inverted pendulum is used in many applications and it is a classic research area in control theory which is still active.

The aim of this project is to model and analyze the behavior of a reaction wheel inverted pendulum, in the form of a one-frame Cubli, and to design a controller capable of balancing it in equilibrium position. 

A controller was designed using classical control methods as root locus and Nyquist criterion. However, the findings suggest that such a controller is not suitable due to the structure of the plant. Thus the final design is done through state space representation.

Moreover, a solution for measuring its angular position using only internally mounted sensors was designed to be able to make it portable to a full Cubli. 

Finally, the performance of the system was tested in simulation and on the real prototype to ensure that it fulfills the needed requirements.
