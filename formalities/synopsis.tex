Nowadays, the inverted pendulum is used in many applications and it is a classic research area in control theory which is still active.

The aim of this project is to model and analyze the behavior of a reaction wheel inverted pendulum, in the form of a one-frame Cubli, and to design a controller capable of balance it in equilibrium position. 

Moreover, a solution for measuring its angular position using only internally mounted sensors is to be designed to be able to use it in a full Cubli. 

Finally, the performance of all the designs are tested in simulation and in the real prototype to ensure that they fulfill the needed requirements.
